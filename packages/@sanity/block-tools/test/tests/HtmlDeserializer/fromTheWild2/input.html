<p>You might think you‚Äôre writing JSX:</p>

<pre><code class="jsx">&lt;marquee bgcolor=&quot;#ffa7c4&quot;&gt;hi&lt;/marquee&gt;
	</code></pre>

<p>But really, you‚Äôre calling a function:</p>

<pre><code class="jsx">React.createElement(
		/* type */ 'marquee',
		/* props */ { bgcolor: '#ffa7c4' },
		/* children */ 'hi'
	)
	</code></pre>

<p>
  And that function gives you back an object. We call this object a React <em>element</em>. It tells
  React what to render next. Your components return a tree of them.
</p>

<pre><code class="jsx{9}">{
		type: 'marquee',
		props: {
			bgcolor: '#ffa7c4',
			children: 'hi',
		},
		key: null,
		ref: null,
		$$typeof: Symbol.for('react.element'), // üßê Who dis
	}
	</code></pre>

<p>
  If you used React you might be familiar with <code>type</code>, <code>props</code>,
  <code>key</code>, and <code>ref</code> fields.
  <strong
    >But what is <code>$$typeof</code>? And why does it have a <code>Symbol()</code> as a
    value?</strong
  >
</p>

<p>
  That‚Äôs another one of those things that you don‚Äôt <em>need</em> to know to use React, but that
  will make you feel good when you do. There‚Äôs also some tips about security in this post that you
  might want to know. Maybe one day you‚Äôll write your own UI library and all of this will come in
  handy. I certainly hope so.
</p>

<p>
  Before client-side UI libraries became common and added basic protection, it was common for app
  code to construct HTML and insert it into the DOM:
</p>

<pre><code class="jsx">const messageEl = document.getElementById('message');
	messageEl.innerHTML = '&lt;p&gt;' + message.text + '&lt;/p&gt;';
	</code></pre>

<p>
  That works fine, except when your <code>message.text</code> is something like
  <code>'&lt;img src onerror=&quot;stealYourPassword()&quot;&gt;'</code>.
  <strong
    >You don‚Äôt want things written by strangers to appear verbatim in your app‚Äôs rendered
    HTML.</strong
  >
</p>

<p>
  (Fun fact: if you only do client-side rendering, a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag here wouldn‚Äôt
  let you run JavaScript. But
  <a
    href="https://gomakethings.com/preventing-cross-site-scripting-attacks-when-using-innerhtml-in-vanilla-javascript/"
    >don‚Äôt let this</a
  >
  lull you into a false sense of security.)
</p>

<p>
  To protect against such attacks, you can use safe APIs like
  <code>document.createTextNode()</code> or <code>textContent</code> that only deal with text. You
  can also preemptively ‚Äúescape‚Äù inputs by replacing potentially dangerous characters like
  <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code> and others in any user-provided text.
</p>

<p>
  Still, the cost of a mistake is high and it‚Äôs a hassle to remember it every time you interpolate a
  user-written string into your output.
  <strong
    >This is why modern libraries like React escape text content for strings by default:</strong
  >
</p>

<pre><code class="jsx">&lt;p&gt;
		{message.text}
	&lt;/p&gt;
	</code></pre>

<p>
  If <code>message.text</code> is a malicious string with an <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> or another
  tag, it won‚Äôt turn into a real <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag. React will escape the content and
  <em>then</em> insert it into the DOM. So instead of seeing the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag you‚Äôll
  just see its markup.
</p>

<p>
  To render arbitrary HTML inside a React element, you have to write
  <code>dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: message.text }}</code
  >. <strong>The fact that it‚Äôs clumsy to write is a <em>feature</em>.</strong> It‚Äôs meant to be
  highly visible so that you can catch it in code reviews and codebase audits.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Does it mean React is entirely safe from injection attacks? No.</strong> HTML and DOM
  offer
  <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/3473#issuecomment-90594748"
    >plenty of attack surface</a
  >
  that is too difficult or slow for React or other UI libraries to mitigate against. Most of the
  remaining attack vectors involve attributes. For example, if you render
  <code>&lt;a href={user.website}&gt;</code>, beware of the user whose website is
  <code>'javascript: stealYourPassword()'</code>. Spreading user input like
  <code>&lt;div {...userData}&gt;</code> is rare but also dangerous.
</p>

<p>
  React <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10506">could</a> provide more protection
  over time but in many cases these are consequences of server issues that
  <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/3473#issuecomment-91327040">should</a> be fixed
  there anyway.
</p>

<p>
  Still, escaping text content is a reasonable first line of defence that catches a lot of potential
  attacks. Isn‚Äôt it nice to know that code like this is safe?
</p>

<pre><code class="jsx">// Escaped automatically
	&lt;p&gt;
		{message.text}
	&lt;/p&gt;
	</code></pre>

<p>
  <strong>Well, that wasn‚Äôt always true either.</strong> And that‚Äôs where
  <code>$$typeof</code> comes in.
</p>

<p>React elements are plain objects by design:</p>

<pre><code class="jsx">{
		type: 'marquee',
		props: {
			bgcolor: '#ffa7c4',
			children: 'hi',
		},
		key: null,
		ref: null,
		$$typeof: Symbol.for('react.element'),
	}
	</code></pre>

<p>
  While normally you create them with <code>React.createElement()</code>, it is not required. There
  are valid use cases for React to support plain element objects written like I just did above. Of
  course, you probably wouldn‚Äôt <em>want</em> to write them like this ‚Äî but this
  <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/3583#issuecomment-90296667">can be</a> useful for
  an optimizing compiler, passing UI elements between workers, or for decoupling JSX from the React
  package.
</p>

<p>
  However,
  <strong>if your server has a hole that lets the user store an arbitrary JSON object</strong> while
  the client code expects a string, this could become a problem:
</p>

<pre><code class="jsx{2-10,15}">// Server could have a hole that lets user store JSON
	let expectedTextButGotJSON = {
		type: 'div',
		props: {
			dangerouslySetInnerHTML: {
				__html: '/* put your exploit here */'
			},
		},
		// ...
	};
	let message = { text: expectedTextButGotJSON };

	// Dangerous in React 0.13
	&lt;p&gt;
		{message.text}
	&lt;/p&gt;
	</code></pre>

<p>
  In that case, React 0.13 would be
  <a href="http://danlec.com/blog/xss-via-a-spoofed-react-element">vulnerable</a> to an XSS attack.
  To clarify, again, <strong>this attack depends on an existing server hole</strong>. Still, React
  could do a better job of protecting people against it. And starting with React 0.14, it does.
</p>

<p>
  The fix in React 0.14 was to
  <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/4832">tag every React element with a Symbol</a>:
</p>

<pre><code class="jsx{9}">{
		type: 'marquee',
		props: {
			bgcolor: '#ffa7c4',
			children: 'hi',
		},
		key: null,
		ref: null,
		$$typeof: Symbol.for('react.element'),
	}
	</code></pre>

<p>
  This works because you can‚Äôt just put <code>Symbol</code>s in JSON.
  <strong
    >So even if the server has a security hole and returns JSON instead of text, that JSON can‚Äôt
    include <code>Symbol.for('react.element')</code>.</strong
  >
  React will check <code>element.$$typeof</code>, and will refuse to process the element if it‚Äôs
  missing or invalid.
</p>

<p>
  The nice thing about using <code>Symbol.for()</code> specifically is that
  <strong>Symbols are global between environments like iframes and workers.</strong> So this fix
  doesn‚Äôt prevent passing trusted elements between different parts of the app even in more exotic
  conditions. Similarly, even if there are multiple copies of React on the page, they can still
  ‚Äúagree‚Äù on the valid <code>$$typeof</code> value.
</p>

<p>
  What about the browsers that
  <a
    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol#Browser_compatibility"
    >don‚Äôt support</a
  >
  Symbols?
</p>

<p>
  Alas, they don‚Äôt get this extra protection. React still includes the <code>$$typeof</code> field
  on the element for consistency, but it‚Äôs
  <a
    href="https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/8482cbe22d1a421b73db602e1f470c632b09f693/packages/shared/ReactSymbols.js#L14-L16"
    >set to a number</a
  >
  ‚Äî <code>0xeac7</code>.
</p>

<p>Why this number specifically? <code>0xeac7</code> kinda looks like ‚ÄúReact‚Äù.</p>
