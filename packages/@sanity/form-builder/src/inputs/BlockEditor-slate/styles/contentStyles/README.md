## Styling content styles

It is important that all styles use padding
and not margin to position its content within the container element.
Otherwise it will be "gaps" in the editor, making droptargeting/etc difficult.

Blocks must also fill the width of the editor 100%, have height auto,
and padding of 1em between each other as a general rule
