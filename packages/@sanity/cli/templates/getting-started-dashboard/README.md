## Features

Here are some features that we already have set up so you can explore at your own pace:

### Customised document previews

You can quickly and visually test the data that will be used by the front end directly in the studio. ([documentation](https://www.sanity.io/blog/evolve-authoring-experiences-with-views-and-split-panes))

</p>

### References input

You can edit (and create) documents from a different document with a different schema (for example, you can create a `human` and assign it immediately to a `pet` that you were already editing! ) ([documentation](https://www.sanity.io/docs/reference-type))

</p>

### Image input - crop and hotspot (and how that affects different elements)

With the hotspot and crop tool in the image input you can very quickly narrow down to which part of the image you want to focus on without having to upload different assets ([documentation](https://www.sanity.io/docs/image-type#hotspot-3e6da78954a8))

### Image input

Use the Unsplash and Media browser plugins from the start!

You can test out how the Unsplash and Media browser plugins are used and explore how to use them ([documentation](https://www.sanity.io/plugins?category=assetSource))

### Array input types

You can see how the array inputs were used (in conjunction with references in places) and how we were able to use them in the previews by using GROQ ([documentation](https://www.sanity.io/docs/array-type))

### GROQ

GROQ is Sanity's open-source query language. It's a powerful and intuitive language that's easy to learn. ([documentation](https://www.sanity.io/docs/how-queries-work))

See how we've used GROQ in the previews to fetch data and how we've read it on the rendering of the component. In the examples, we make sure that you can not only fetch the last published version but the drafts that haven't been published as well ([documentation](https://www.sanity.io/docs/query-cheat-sheet))
