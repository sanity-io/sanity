// document consistent with the mutations we have received from the server. As long as nothing out of
// the ordinary happens, we can track all changes by hooking into the onMutation callback, but we
// must also respect onRebase events that fire when we have to backtrack because one of our optimistically
// applied patches were rejected, or some bastard was able to slip a mutation in between ours own.
