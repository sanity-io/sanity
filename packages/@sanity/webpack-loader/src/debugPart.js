 * Couldn't figure out a way to simply resolve a part to a string
 * without first resolving the request to a file. This seems like
 * a weakness in webpack, or perhaps my understanding of the system.

 * TL;DR: This file isn't actually used, but needs to be here until
 * someone can come up with a better solution :D
