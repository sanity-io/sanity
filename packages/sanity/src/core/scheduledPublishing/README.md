# Getting started

## Installation

This feature is included by default in your studio.

## Usage

**This will automatically:**

1. Add a Schedule [document action][document-actions] to all document schema types
2. Display a Scheduled [document badge][document-badges] to all document schema types
3. Add the dedicated Schedules tool in your navigation bar

### Customize input date formatting

To change the date formatting used when creating and editing schedules, pass a [valid `date-fns` formatted token](https://date-fns.org/docs/format) as an option.

```js
defineConfig({
  ...yourConfig,
  scheduledPublishing: {
    enabled: true,
    // E.g. 12/25/2000 6:30 AM, make sure to specify minutes and hours if you are specifying a custom format.
    inputDateTimeFormat: 'MM/dd/yyyy h:mm a',
  },
})
```

If left unspecified, this plugin will default to `dd/MM/yyyy HH:mm`.

### Configure the document action

This example assumes [you've customized your document actions][document-actions] and would like to only show the Schedule button on `movie` documents only.

The Schedule document action allows users to both create and edit existing schedules directly from the form editor. It is added to all document types by the plugin,
so you should remove it from types that should NOT have it.

```js
import {scheduledPublishing, ScheduleAction} from '@sanity/scheduled-publishing'

export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  plugins: [scheduledPublishing()],
  document: {
    actions: (previousActions, {schemaType}) => {
      /*
       * Please note that this will only alter the visibility of the button in the studio.
       * Users with document publish permissions will be able to create schedules directly
       * via the Scheduled Publishing API.
       */
      if (schemaType.name !== 'movie') {
        // Remove the schedule action from any documents that is not 'movie'.
        return previousActions.filter((action) => action !== ScheduleAction)
      }
      return previousActions
    },
  },
})
```

### Configure the document badge

This example assumes [you've customised your own document badges][document-badges] and would like to only show the Scheduled badge on `movie` documents only.

The Scheduled document badge displays whether the current document is scheduled and when it will be published if so. It is added to all document types by the plugin,
so you should remove it from types that should NOT have it.

```js
import {scheduledPublishing, ScheduledBadge} from '@sanity/scheduled-publishing'

export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  plugins: [scheduledPublishing()],
  document: {
    actions: (previousBadges, {schemaType}) => {
      if (schemaType.name !== 'movie') {
        // Remove the schedule badge from any documents that is not 'movie'.
        return previousBadges.filter((badge) => badge !== ScheduledBadge)
      }
      return previousBadges
    },
  },
})
```

## FAQ

<details>
<summary>What's the relationship between Schedules and my dataset?</summary>

Schedules sit adjacent to your dataset and can be managed using the [Scheduling API][scheduling-api] (which this plugin does for you).

Schedules are a unique resource and are linked to, but do not exist within your Sanity project and dataset. It's important to understand the following behavior:

- As schedules are not contained within a projectâ€™s dataset, you cannot query them via GROQ or GraphQL.
- Deleting a dataset will immediately delete all schedules.
- Deleting a project will immediately delete all schedules.
- `sanity dataset export` will not include schedules and `sanity dataset import` does not support importing schedules.
- Server-side copying of datasets does not include schedules.
- When a project is disabled or blocked, all scheduled publishes will invariably fail as mutations will not be allowed on the dataset.

More information can be found on the [Scheduling API][scheduling-api] page.

<details>
<summary>Where is time zone data pulled from?</summary>

- Time zones and their corresponding cities, regions and daylight savings offsets are directly sourced from the [@vvo/dztb][@vvo/dztb] library, which is automatically updated with data from [geonames.org](https://www.geonames.org/).

</details>

<details>
<summary>Will scheduled documents with validation errors publish?</summary>

- **Yes.** Documents scheduled to publish in future will do so, even if they contain validation errors. This also applies to scheduled documents that you manually opt to publish immediately via the tool.
