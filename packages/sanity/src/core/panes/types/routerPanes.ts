/**
 * Represents the state of the `panes` inside the structure-tool router
 *
 * - The structure tool stores the state of the current panes inside of the router.
 * - The panes are stored in groups delimited in the URL by `;`.
 * - In each group, there can be one or more sibling (aka split) panes delimited
 *   by `|`.
 * - Each item pane can contain it's own parameters and payloads
 * - Per item pane in each group, if not specified separately, the ID, params,
 *   and payload will be inherited from the first item pane in the pane group
 *   (unless it's an `exclusiveParam`)
 *
 * E.g. `/structure/books;book-123|,view=preview` will parse to:
 *
 * ```js
 * [
 *   // first pane group
 *   [{id: 'book'}],
 *
 *   // second pane group
 *   [
 *     [
 *       // first pane item
 *       {id: 'book-123'},
 *       // second pane item
 *       {id: 'book-123', params: {view: 'preview'}},
 *     ],
 *   ],
 * ]
 * ```
