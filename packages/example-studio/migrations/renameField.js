// This example shows how you may write a migration script that renames a field (name => fullname)
// on a specific document type (author).
// This will migrate documents in batches of 100 and continue patching until no more documents are
// returned from the query.
//
// This script can safely be run, even if documents are being concurrently modified by others.
// If a document gets modified in the time between fetch => submit patch, this script will fail,
// but can safely be re-run multiple times until it eventually runs out of documents to migrate.

// A few things to note:
// - This script will exit if any of the mutations fail due to a revision mismatch (which means the
//   document was edited between fetch => update)
// - The query must eventually return an empty set, or else this script will continue indefinitely

// Fetching documents that matches the precondition for the migration.
// NOTE: This query should eventually return an empty set of documents to mark the migration
// as complete
