  "review": "I'm extremely disappointed with this purchase. The sound quality is terrible, they break easily, and customer service was unhelpful when I tried to return them. I would not recommend these headphones to anyone. Complete waste of money and I regret buying them. The battery life is also much shorter than advertised."
