# [Example Name]

<!-- 
BEST PRACTICE: Use a clear, descriptive name that explains what the example does
- For general functions: "Auto-Tag Function" instead of "Tagging Example"
- For external service integrations: Include the service name in the title
  Example: "Updating Search Index with Algolia" instead of "Search Integration"
  Example: "Syncing Products with Shopify" instead of "Product Sync"
  Example: "Sending Notifications to Slack" instead of "Notification Function"
-->

- [Specific benefit #3 - mention scalability/consistency gains]
- [Additional benefits as needed]

## Compatible Templates

<!-- 
BEST PRACTICE:
- Specify which Sanity templates the example is designed to work with
- Include schema requirements if the example assumes specific document structures
- Provide setup instructions for adding missing fields to existing schemas
- Link to the specific templates for easy access
- Include both general compatibility and specific tested templates
-->

This function is built to be compatible with [specific template(s) or "any of the official templates"]. We recommend testing the function out in one of those after you have installed them locally.

### Adding required fields to your schema

If you're using the [specific template name], you may need to add required fields:

1. Open `path/to/schema/file.ts`
2. Add this field to the `fields` array:

```typescript
defineField({
  name: 'fieldName',
  title: 'Field Title',
  type: 'field-type',
  description: 'Description of what this field is used for',
}),
```

3. Deploy your updated schema:

```bash
# From the studio/ folder (adjust path as needed for template structure)
npx sanity schema deploy
```

## Implementation

<!-- 
BEST PRACTICE:
- Provide step-by-step instructions
- Include all necessary code snippets
- Use proper syntax highlighting for code blocks
- Test instructions to ensure they work
- Include both CLI commands and configuration examples
- Specify correct working directories for monorepo templates
- Include function dependency installation
-->

**Important:** Run these commands from the root of your project (not inside the `studio/` folder).

1. **Initialize the example**

   For a new project:

   ```bash
   npx sanity blueprints init --example [example-name]
   ```

   For an existing project:

   ```bash
   npx sanity blueprints add function --example [example-name]
   ```

2. **Add configuration to your blueprint**

   ```ts
   // sanity.blueprint.ts
   import { defineBlueprint, defineDocumentFunction } from "@sanity/blueprints";

   export default defineBlueprint({
     resources: [
       defineDocumentFunction({
         type: "sanity.function.document",
         name: "[function-name]",
         src: "./functions/[function-name]",
         memory: 2,
         timeout: 30,
         event: {
           on: ["publish"],
           filter: "_type == 'document-type' && condition",
           projection: "_id",
         },
       }),
     ],
   });
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**

   Install dependencies in the project root:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   And install function dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install @sanity/functions
   cd functions/[function-name]
   npm install
   cd ../..
   ```

4. **Make sure you have a schema deployed**

   From the studio folder, run:

   ```bash
   # In the studio/ folder (adjust path for template structure)
   npx sanity schema deploy
   ```

## Testing the function locally

<!-- 
BEST PRACTICE:
- Always include local testing instructions
- Provide multiple testing approaches (basic, interactive, custom data)
- Include debugging tips
- Mention Node.js version requirements
- Add troubleshooting for common issues
- Document the requirement for real document IDs in dataset
- Include proper folder navigation for monorepo templates
-->

You can test the [example-name] function locally using the Sanity CLI before deploying it to production.

**Important:** Document functions require that the document ID used in testing actually exists in your dataset. The examples below show how to work with real document IDs.

### 1. Basic Function Test

Since document functions require the document ID to exist in your dataset, create a test document first:

```bash
# From the studio/ folder, create a test document
cd studio
npx sanity documents create ../functions/[function-name]/document.json --replace
```

Then test the function with the created document (from project root):

```bash
# Back to project root for function testing
cd ..
npx sanity functions test [function-name] --file functions/[function-name]/document.json
```

**Alternative:** Test with a real document from your dataset:

```bash
# From the studio/ folder, find and export an existing document
cd studio
npx sanity documents query "*[_type == 'document-type'][0]" > ../real-document.json

# Back to project root for function testing
cd ..
npx sanity functions test [function-name] --file real-document.json
```

### 2. Interactive Development Mode

Start the development server for interactive testing:

```bash
npx sanity functions dev
```

This opens an interactive playground where you can test functions with custom data

### 3. Test with Custom Data

For custom data testing, you still need to use a real document ID that exists in your dataset:

```bash
# From the studio/ folder, create or find a real document ID
cd studio
REAL_DOC_ID=$(npx sanity documents query "*[_type == 'document-type'][0]._id")

# Create a temporary JSON file with custom data in project root
cd ..
cat > test-custom-data.json << EOF
{
  "_type": "document-type",
  "_id": $REAL_DOC_ID,
  "field": "Your custom data here..."
}
EOF

# Test with the custom data file
npx sanity functions test [function-name] --file test-custom-data.json
```

### 4. Test with Real Document Data

The most reliable approach is to test with existing documents from your dataset:

```bash
# From the studio/ folder, find and export a document that matches your function's filter
cd studio
npx sanity documents query "*[_type == 'document-type' && condition][0]" > ../test-real-document.json

# Back to project root for function testing
cd ..
npx sanity functions test [function-name] --file test-real-document.json
```

### 5. Enable Debugging

To see detailed logs during testing, modify the function temporarily to add logging:

```typescript
// Add this to your function for debugging
console.log('Event data:', JSON.stringify(event.data, null, 2))
console.log('Result:', result)
```

### Testing Tips

- **Use real document IDs** - Document functions require IDs that exist in your dataset
- **Query for test documents** - Use `npx sanity documents query` to find suitable test documents
- **Use Node.js v22.x** locally to match production runtime
- **Test edge cases** like missing fields or unexpected data
- **Check function logs** in CLI output for debugging
- **Test without external API calls** first when applicable
- **Create test content** - If you don't have suitable documents, create some test documents first

## Requirements

<!-- 
BEST PRACTICE:
- List all prerequisites clearly
- Include both technical and account requirements
- Mention schema requirements specifically
- Note any paid features or API access needed
-->

- A Sanity project
- [Specific schema requirements - be detailed about field names and types]
- [Any Sanity feature requirements (Functions, AI, etc.)]
- [External service requirements if applicable]

## Usage Example

<!-- 
BEST PRACTICE:
- Show the function in action with a realistic scenario
- Use numbered steps to show the workflow
- Include before/after states when relevant

-->

When [trigger condition occurs], the function automatically:

1. [Step 1 - what triggers the function]
2. [Step 2 - what data it processes]
3. [Step 3 - what actions it takes]
4. [Step 4 - what the result/outcome is]

This results in [clear description of the end benefit].

CODING GUIDELINES FOR FUNCTION EXAMPLES:

When writing function examples, follow these best practices to ensure
consistency and beginner-friendliness:

## Code Quality Standards

1. **Always use TypeScript** - But keep typing light to maintain readability
   - Use explicit types for function parameters and return values
   - Avoid complex generic types or advanced TypeScript features
   - Focus on clarity over type sophistication

2. **Documentation and Comments**
   - Use light inline comments for key concepts and non-obvious logic
   - Avoid over-commenting obvious operations
   - Include comments explaining Sanity-specific concepts (setIfMissing, projections, etc.)

3. **Beginner-Friendly Patterns**
   - Avoid complex patterns that might confuse newcomers
   - Use straightforward control flow (avoid deeply nested logic)
   - Prefer explicit operations over clever one-liners
   - Structure code in logical, easy-to-follow steps

4. **Error Handling**
   - Include error handling for common edge cases
   - Use try-catch blocks for external API calls and database operations
   - Provide meaningful error messages in logs
   - Handle missing fields and unexpected data gracefully

5. **Self-Contained Code**
   - Make examples work independently without external dependencies
   - Include all necessary imports and configuration
   - Avoid requiring complex setup beyond basic Sanity project requirements
   - Keep external service dependencies minimal and well-documented

6. **Clear Input/Output Examples**
   - Provide realistic sample data in document.json
   - Include TypeScript types that show expected input structure
   - Document what the function returns or modifies
   - Show before/after states in documentation

7. **Naming and Structure**
   - Use descriptive variable and function names
   - Choose names that explain purpose over implementation
   - Structure code in logical flow from input → processing → output
   - Group related operations together

8. **Package Configuration**
   - Include complete package.json with all necessary dependencies
   - Use stable, well-supported package versions
   - Include blueprintResourceItem configuration
   - Add clear example instructions

## Example Structure Checklist

Every function example should include:
- [ ] index.ts with TypeScript implementation
- [ ] package.json with dependencies and blueprint config
- [ ] document.json with realistic test data
- [ ] README.md following this template
- [ ] Error handling for common edge cases
- [ ] Clear inline documentation
- [ ] Self-contained, runnable code

TEMPLATE MAINTENANCE NOTES:
- Keep sections in this order for consistency
- Always test instructions before publishing
- Include realistic sample data in document.json
- Ensure all code snippets use proper syntax highlighting
- Update links when examples are moved or renamed
