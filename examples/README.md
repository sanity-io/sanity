## üîß Functions

The `functions/` directory contains examples of [Sanity Functions](https://www.sanity.io/docs/compute-and-ai/functions-introduction) - serverless functions that run in Sanity's cloud environment. Each function example includes:

- **Configuration** (`package.json`) - Dependencies and blueprint resource configuration
- **Test data** (`document.json`) - Sample data for testing
- **Documentation** (`README.md`) - Usage instructions and explanations

### Key Files

- **`sanity.blueprint.ts`** - Automatically discovers and configures all function examples for easy testing
- **`package.json`** - Shared dependencies for all function examples
- **`vite.config.js`** - Build configuration for bundling functions

### Available Function Examples

- **[auto-tag](./functions/auto-tag/README.md)** - AI-powered automatic tagging for blog posts
- **[first-published](./functions/first-published/README.md)** - Automatic timestamp tracking for first publication
