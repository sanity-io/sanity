This repository contains the core Sanity front-end modules. It uses [Lerna](https://lernajs.io/) to manage cross-dependencies, publishing and to simplify workflows.

Unless you want to modify/contribute to the core Sanity components, you're probably better off having a look at the [Sanity documentation](http://sanity.io/docs/) that explains how to quickly get started using our hosted backend.
