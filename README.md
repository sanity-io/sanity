## Getting started

If you are running Node the commands below install the Sanity CLI tooling and boostraps a new project for you. Not running Node? Have a look at [this](https://www.sanity.io/help/a5f6caba-53c9-4a9f-96ef-1bd1ae8f5c10).

```
npm install -g @sanity/cli
sanity init
```

Watch [Getting started with Sanity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ceM_tSus_M) on YouTube.

Check out the [schema documentation](https://www.sanity.io/docs/content-studio/the-schema) and customize your data structure. When you're happy, just `sanity deploy` to host the editor with us and head over to [sanity.io](https://www.sanity.io/manage) to invite editors.

As they're merrily content managing you can start setting up a front-end to render your data based on one of the [demos](#sample-frontends) we have available.

Feel totally free to ping us on [Slack](https://slack.sanity.io) for a chat should you have questions along the way!
