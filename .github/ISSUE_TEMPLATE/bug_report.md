**Security issue?**

Any security issues should be submitted directly to [security@sanity.io](mailto:security@sanity.io). In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:

- Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
- Can I disable something for other people? If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue. Note that even if you answer "no" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure, just email us at [security@sanity.io](mailto:security@sanity.io)

**About follow-ups:** If we need additional information to help with your issue, we'll let you know by adding a `needs-more-info` label. You'll have plenty of time to respond (we'll send a friendly reminder after 10 days). If we don't hear back after 14 days total, the issue will be automatically closed to keep things organized, but you're always welcome to reopen it or create a new one when you're ready. We appreciate your contribution to making Sanity better!
