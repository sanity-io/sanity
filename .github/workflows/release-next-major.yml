      - name: Rewrite version
        # Q: Why are we doing this?
        # A:
        # lerna version does not support --canary (for some reason, it's only supported for lerna publish)
        # When publishing tagged canary releases, we want the version to be:
        # <conventional-commit-bump>.<timestamp>+<commit-hash>
        # However, the lerna version command we run above does not append the commit hash, and it
        # always sets the <timestamp> part to "0" (because its based on commits ahead.
        # So, in order to get the desired target version, we need to post-process package versions
        # by manually getting the number of commits in the branch since last release, and replace the "0"
        # with the timestamp, and finally append the commit hash.
        # Its important to use timestamp for next-major, because this branch is regularily rebased on next, which
        # means the "commits-ahead" number will be repeating
        # e.g. consider the following timeline:
        # - v4.10.0 is released from main, next major is 2 commits ahead, v5.0.0-next-major.2 gets released from `next-major`
        # - v4.11.0 is released from main, next major is rebased against `main`, but still 2 commits ahead
        # Now, we'll attempt to release v5.0.0-next-major.2, which has already been published, causing conflict during publish.
        # Using timestamp instead, fixes the issue, as in the above example we'd
        # get e.g. v5.0.0-next-major.20251210114512 and v5.0.0-next-major.20251210120356
        # so you might have a release
